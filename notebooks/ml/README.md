# ml Python Package
This is a python package that the notebooks will use to generate moving averages (along with other utility functions). We do this sop we can just generate moving averages with various sized windows. We want to refrain from saving many csv files, so we will just generate them when we need them, the tradeoff being computation time vs. space.
