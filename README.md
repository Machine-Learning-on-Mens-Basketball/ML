# ML
This repo contains all the machine/deep learning needed for the project. In this repo
we also process the data to get it ready for feature engineering.

## Data
The data used in this repo is from [sportsipy](https://github.com/roclark/sportsipy)
(formerly known as sportsreference).

## Installation
This project uses Python 3.8.10. At the time of writing, the most recent version of
Python is version 3.9.6. We decided to use 3.8 for compatibility reasons with some
packages. We recommend using a virtual environment if you want to fork this repo and work
on it yourself. Here is a [link](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/venv.html) to
Python's official documentation on virtual environments. Once the appropriate version of
Python and pip are installed and you are in your virtual environment, run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
which will install all of the required packages needed to run the Jupyter notebook
files.
